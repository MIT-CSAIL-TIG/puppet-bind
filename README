This is the CSAIL Puppet module for BIND.

It was created by Garrett Wollman <wollman@csail.mit.edu>
after looking at the umpteen other BIND modules and being
utterly unsatisfied as a result of either fundamental
portability failures or underlying design errors.

The following are the goals for this module:

- Successfully configure BIND in both recursive resolver and
  authoritative name server modes.

- Support views, at least to the extent that a name server
  can be configured to have a local caching resolver despite
  also being authoritative for some non-empty zones.

- Work on multiple platforms.

- Fully support DNSsec (public-key) and TSIG (shared-key)
  authentication for the relevant services.

The following are explicit non-goals for this module:

- Generating zone files.  Zone files are not configuration,
  and come from a provisioning database.
