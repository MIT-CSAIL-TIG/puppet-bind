# The following paths vary a lot between systems; they are listed here
# for documentation purposes only (failure to define these to real
# values will break manifest compilation).  N.B.: ~ is YAML syntax for
# the distinguished "undefined" value.

# The parent directory for all of of the configuration files (should
# not be writable by the user named(8) runs as):
bind::config::directory: ~

# A directory where named(8) can write temporary files, update
# journals, auto-maintained trust anchors, root hints, etc.  This is
# also the directory where dump files will get written if not
# otherwise specified:
bind::config:working_dir: working

# Name of a file where named(8) can write its process ID on startup.
# Needs to be writable by the user named runs as, so it might not be
# directly in /var/run.  Many times the parent directory of this file
# is created automatically by startup scripts:
bind::config::pid_file: ~

# Name of the cache dump file that gets written when you do "rndc
# dump":
bind::config::dump_file: ~

# Name of the file where statistics get written, if configured and
# enabled:
bind::config::statistics_file: ~

# Defaults that should not need changing (and may in fact be
# hard-coded elsewhere in this module).  Paths are relative to
# bind::config::directory, above.

# Directory where original master zone files are located (if using
# inline-signing, must be writable by the user named(8) runs as due to
# bugs in BIND):
bind::config::master_dir: master

# Directory where transferred copies of slave zone files are located
# (writable by the user named(8) runs as):
bind::config::slave_dir: slave

# Directory where cryptographic keying material is located (must be
# readable and searchable by the user named(8) runs as, and should not
# be searchable by any non-administrative user):
