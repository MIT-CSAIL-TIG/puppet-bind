	// There are two ways you might handle the root zone.  The
	// traditional way is to use a hints file, which is what we
	// implement here.  The other way you could do it is by
	// shadow-secondarying the root zone (ICANN has specific
	// servers configured to allow zone transfers for that
	// reason).
